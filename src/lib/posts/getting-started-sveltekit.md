# Getting Started with SvelteKit

SvelteKit is a framework for building web applications of all sizes, with a beautiful development experience and flexible filesystem-based routing.

## Why SvelteKit?

Unlike other frameworks, Svelte compiles your code to tiny, framework-less vanilla JS — your app starts fast and stays fast.

## Setting Up

To create a new project, run:

\`\`\`bash
npm create svelte@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
\`\`\`
